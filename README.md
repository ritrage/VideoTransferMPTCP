# VideoTransferMPTCP

keep your video you want to send in same folder as videostreamer.py

in another machine run receiver.py first

and then in the machine containing video run videostreamer.py

and yes, don't forget to change the ip address of server in videostreamer.py

If you do not have mptcp then it will give an error of protocol not found.
